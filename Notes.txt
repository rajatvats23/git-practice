Day 1 Git - Complete Notes
Setup (One-time):
bashgit config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
git config --global --list  # Verify

Config is LOCAL to machine, not GitHub
--global = all repos, without = current repo only

Basic Workflow:
bashgit init                    # Initialize repo (creates .git folder)
git status                  # Check file states
git add <file>              # Stage file (Working → Staging)
git commit -m "message"     # Save snapshot (Staging → Repository)
git log                     # View history
git log --oneline           # Compact history
3 Areas:

Working Directory = your files now
Staging Area = files ready for snapshot
Repository = saved commits

Commits:

Each commit = unique hash (e.g., f376db4)
Commit ID used for: revert, checkout, show
git show <hash> = view specific commit

Branches:
bashgit branch <name>           # Create branch (copies from current position)
git branch                  # List branches (* = current)
git checkout <name>         # Switch branch
git checkout -b <name>      # Create + switch
git merge <branch>          # Merge INTO current branch

Branch = separate timeline from current position
Merging is directional: you're ON branch X, pulling FROM branch Y

HEAD:

Pointer to current position (branch + commit)
HEAD -> master = on master branch, at latest commit
Detached HEAD = pointing to old commit directly (not a branch)

Merge Conflicts:

Happen when same line edited in both branches
Resolution: edit file → git add → git commit
Conflict markers: <<<<<<< HEAD, =======, >>>>>>> branch

Remote (GitHub):
bashgit remote add origin <url>      # Add remote, nickname it 'origin'
git remote -v                    # List remotes
git push -u origin master        # Upload to GitHub (first time)
git push                         # Upload (after -u set)
git pull origin master           # Download from GitHub
git clone <url>                  # Download repo (auto-creates origin)

origin = nickname for remote URL (can be any name)
Git works 100% offline, GitHub optional
Local and remote independent, sync with push/pull

Key Concepts:

Git = local version control, works offline
GitHub = remote backup/collaboration (optional)
Branches cheap, create liberally
Commits are snapshots, not diffs
HEAD = "You Are Here" marker
